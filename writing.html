    <p>Darlene stood over the kitchen sink, sweating from the humidity and idly drying a glass with a dish towel, staring out the back window at the oak in the yard. Something always bugged her about that tree; there was one limb, just above vertical-center, that was never quite ‘right’. It was as an atonal slash that interrupted harmony.</p>
    <p>Out in the shed Darlene choked on dust as she dug through layers of rusted tools, old beer signs, and never-assembled bike frames until she found the rope she sought. She heaved it over the limb, and transferred all of her weight to the tree.</p>
    <p>There was a crack, and Darlene was eased to the ground as the limb detached. Only, it didn’t sever cleanly; Darlene watched the bark adjacent to the limb peel off the trunk and strip the lower half of the tree bare, exposing sickly underbark for the first time.</p>
    <p>----</p>
    <p>Darlene stood over the kitchen sink in her robe and slippers, eating a bowl of room-temperature grits and staring at nothing in particular. Out of the corner of her eye she caught a flash of the tree’s wound. She had been avoiding looking at it for months, but now she took it in. It was the new focal point of the tree.</p>
    <p>Darlene returned from the store that day and got to work meticulously emulating the healthy bark over the gash with umber acrylic. She built up thick layers with her palate knife, defining three-dimensional texture and relief. After she finished, the paint only called attention to what wasn’t there.</p>
    <p>She returned with a bag of shavings acquired from the trash of a local wood shop, which she stained to match the bark and adhered to the paint with craft glue. After many hours, the barkless gash had only been dressed up.</p>
    <p>She couldn’t stand to look at the tree. She bought curtains for the kitchen window, but could never forget the causal source of the room’s darkness.</p>
    <p>On a particularly muggy day, a bolt of heat lightning felled the tree. Darlene heard it from the living room— the tree practically exploded. All that remained were disembodied hunks of rotting oak, and a still-standing half-tree of recreated bark. She couldn’t tell how she felt about it.</p>

    <p>Smoke quickly engulfed his studio, and he could only escape with what could be carried. He scanned the walls hosting decades of work, and left empty-handed.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Geraldine was a master of her craft. Weekdays eight to four she sat at the end of the assembly line on her wooden stool with the day’s three-hair brush clasped delicately between her thumb and index finger, the shift’s 2.54oz tube of medium-viscosity fast-drying black acrylic delicately half-rolled on the now-black table at her side and ready to restock the dime-sized pool.</p>
    <p>Geraldine was the last holdout from a time when her factory buzzed with dozens of craftspeople like herself, each contributing a share of life to the line’s figurines. Over the years, one by one, figurine-painting machines replaced painters. First, for skin. Then, for hair. Though machine-people had an exceptionally difficult time calibrating the eyes, eyes too were eventually mechanized. But the smile, despite the willpower of the best minds in engineering, could not be engineered, and Geraldine now worked in solitude to the tune of the factory’s automatonical heartbeat, painting a single defining stroke on all of the line’s wares.</p>
    <p>Today, for the first time in many months, the steady mechanical rhythm was interrupted by organic footsteps. Harry Klauvin, whose grandfather had founded the company, entered the floor and approached her station.</p>
    <p>“Geraldine...”</p>
    <p>He handed her a ballerina from last month’s run.</p>
    <p>“do you want to tell me why the last four shipments have been returned?”</p>
    <p>Geraldine carefully examined the tiny dancer’s features. The beautiful blue dress was an ethereal cocoon for a graceful figure, captured at the climax of a passionate performance. Her limbs splayed dynamically; her eyes conveyed casual command. Then, Geraldine’s gaze arrived at the painted smile. She gasped. The figurine’s human likeness, taken as the impression of all attributes, was now rendered uncanny. The dancer’s expression filled Geraldine with an overwhelming sense of despair.</p>
    <p>Harry picked up off the line a figure Geraldine had just completed. He shrieked.</p>
    <p>Klauvin Painted Figurines, est. 1921, would shutter that night.</p>

    <p>She worked up the courage to part the curtain just enough to peer through her backwindow. The man on the third floor of the apartment across the alley was still staring.</p>

    <p>He put down his paper and left a generous tip for the waitress, who had smiled through an especially rude interaction with the entitled woman at the adjacent booth. The little bell on the door chimed as he exited into the Wednesday morning sunlight. He passed some children eating ice cream cones on the curb, on his way to the bookstore across the street where an order waited. A horn blared, and the impact sent him airborne. As he lay bleeding out on the shoulder, the tab of acid (that he had, years ago, been hesitant to take but was egged on by his buddy Paul who said that he, Paul, got it personally from the one-and-only Owen Stanley, soundman for the Grateful Dead and legendary LSD pioneer, Owen ‘Bear’ freaking Stanley himself, and that all those rumors about it staying in your spine and whatnot and leading to wicked bad trips when you, like, crack your back in your nursing home-EZ chair are all horseshit anyways) kicked right back in.</p>

    <p>The man’s eye was drawn to a pastel steak of blue and cream among the ashen rubble. He pressed the plastic button on its breast, and the toy began to sing. ‘That’, he said as he turned to his daughter, who knew only the ways of the New World, ‘is birdsong’. She smiled.</p>
